### How I built the Home Network Lab

<ol>
  <li><strong>Added Network Devices</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Placed a wireless router, cable modem, PC, laptop, and a server (labeled cisco.srv) onto the workspace.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Connected Devices with Cables</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>PC and Laptop to the Wireless Router</li>
      <li>Wireless Router to Cable Modem</li>
      <li>Cable Modem to the Server (via simulated Internet)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Configured IP Addresses</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Assigned static or dynamic IP addresses to the PC, Laptop, and Server depending on the network design.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Enabled Wireless Connectivity</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Set up SSID and password on the Wireless Router.</li>
      <li>Configured the Laptop to connect via Wi-Fi.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Verified Connectivity</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Used the Simulation Mode or ping command to test communication between devices and ensure internet access.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
